        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Real estate sector is one of the most globally recognized sectors. It comprises of four sub sectors - housing, retail, hospitality, and commercial. The growth of this sector is well complemented by the growth in the corporate environment and the demand for office space as well as urban and semi-urban accommodations. The construction industry ranks third among the 14 major sectors in terms of direct, indirect and induced effects in all sectors of the economy.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        </p>The Indian real estate market is showing signs of steady recovery with both residential and commercial property segments recording robust performance in the July-September quarter.

        Real estate activity gained momentum during the quarter as the country began to cautiously return to normal economic tempo supported by aggressive vaccination drives.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">

                Top seven Indian property markets recorded over 124% on-year jump in housing sales at 32,358 apartments, data from JLL India showed, while the Knight Frank data recorded 92% rise in housing sales across 8 cities at over 64,010 units.
                "The market seems to have factored in the very low likelihood of a complete lockdown as was seen last year due to the ample availability of the Covid vaccine. Comparatively lower residential prices, attractive interest rates and higher household savings rate over the past year should support housing demand going forward. With the upcoming festive season, the market is gearing up for new project launches and consumers are likely to reciprocate," said Shishir Baijal, CMD, Knight Frank India.</p>
